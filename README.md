## Mythie ## 

World Of Warcraft is my favorite game and a core system of the game offers an ever increasing challenge to players in the form of Mythic+ which is simply a difficulty level for 'Dungeons'. Completing a difficulty within the alloted time allows the player to complete another 'Dungeon' at a higher difficulty. Raider.IO is a web application that aggregates data on these Mythic+ dungeon runs and their API allows me to work on this React Native application. The Raide.IO webapp is amazing, and after looking I found their mobile browser version could use some work. Here we are.

### Goals
 - [x] Learn TypeScript
 - [x] Practice React/React Native
 - [x] Get comfortable with ESlint rules
 - [x] Improve design skills


### MVP 
 - [x] Fetch data from Raider.IO API
 - [x] Design Search component that allows user to guess the users realm as they type
 - [x] Display players best/highest scored run for each dungeon
 - [ ] Display recent runs for each dungeon

### Long Term Plans
 - [ ] Allow users to login via Battle.Net OAuth API
 - [ ] Get character data from Battle.Net API 
   - [ ] Automatically retrieve data on each character
 - [ ] Add Dungeon Information, NPC data, routes, etc...
